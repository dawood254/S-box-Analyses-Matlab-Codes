MATLAB code for S-box analysis Description: 
This repository contains MATLAB code for analysing cryptographic S-boxes. The code implements several algorithms for evaluating the nonlinearity, differential uniformity, Linear Uniformity, and other properties of S-boxes commonly used in symmetric key cryptography. 
Usage: To use the code, simply download or clone the repository and run the MATLAB scripts in the "src" folder. The main functions are documented with comments and examples, and the "tests" folder contains unit tests for verifying the correctness of the algorithms. The code requires MATLAB version R2016b or later, and has been tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
